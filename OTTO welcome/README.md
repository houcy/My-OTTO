# Otto DIY PLUS

This Repository have all open source files for my version of the popular Otto DIY PLUS with the OTTO welcome on 7219MAX MATRIX LED mouth
The Arduino code is modified from the Zowi robot and original OTTO code, it has modified to work with a MAX 7219 LED MATRIX as as mouth as well as other software adjustments.

Please copy all the files in the Library folder to the Arduino IDE Library folder

The main program is inside the OTTO_FULL_MOUTH_HI folder, ensure you are using the latest version of the Arduino IDE.


Happy roboting....


Otto was inspired by another robot BoB the BiPed and programmed using code from [another open source biped robot Zowi](https://github.com/bqlabs/zowi)

Otto's differences are in the assembled size (11cm x 7cm x12cm), cleaner integration of components and expressions. 
Using off the shelf and 3D printed parts, simple electronics connections (almost no welding required), and basic coding skills, [you will be able to build your own cute Otto friend in as little as two hours!](http://www.instructables.com/id/Otto-Build-You-Own-Robot-in-Two-Hours/)

### Otto is design using Autodesk 123D Design software 
[You can modify it for customization](http://www.123dapp.com/Project/Otto-build-your-own-robot/5658683) or further improvements!
Gather all the off the shelf parts in the [BOM file] (https://github.com/OttoDIY/Otto/blob/master/OTTO_V02_BOM_STP_STL/OTTO_BOM.xlsx) that you'll need for this assembly, then follow [the instruction manual] (https://github.com/OttoDIY/Otto/blob/master/OTTO_V02_BOM_STP_STL/OTTO_InstructionManual_V02.pdf)
